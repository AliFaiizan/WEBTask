# I have completed all the tasks

# first i implemented it with redux to make it more scaleable

# to avoid complexity in a rather small project, I did it in a rather simpler way. but the redux code is still there if you want to look at the approach i took.

# I wanted to use some external UI libraries ( tailwindcss / material UI ) to make UI more appeleling but i decided to go with raw CSS. So the Ui is not the highest quality
